          As one of the owners of my company, I had very high expectations for the type of website I wanted to create.  I was very pleased with the work done by Hot Beans.  They worked very hard to create what I had envisioned for our company's website.  Not only were they very knowledgeable and efficient in their work, but they also offered their suggestions and creative ideas time and time again throughout the process of adding numerous pages and features to our website. I was very impressed with the quality of work, customer care, and meticulous attention to detail.  I will surely refer them to any business associates who are looking for quality web designers!<br />
